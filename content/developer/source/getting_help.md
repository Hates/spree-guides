There may be times when using Spree that the documentation doesn't answer all
the questions you may have. There are several other places on the internet where
you can go to ask Spree questions, and they are covered in this guide.

## Mailing List

The first of these places is our [Google Groups mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user). On this list, any user may ask
any question about Spree and it's up to the community to answer it, or in some
cases, a Spree employee may answer the question. 

This list is perfect for *general* questions about Spree. If you think you have
discovered a bug in Spree, please [file an issue on GitHub](#github-issues).

Questions on this list may take some time to answer, so please be patient when
asking them.

## IRC Channel

The IRC channel for Spree is at #spree on irc.freenode.net. Here you can talk to
other users of Spree in real-time. There are sometimes Spree employees who are
opped in the channel who may appear to have an `@` before their name.

## GitHub Issues

The [GitHub issues page for Spree](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues) shows
a list of currently open issues on Spree. If you think you have found a new
issue with Spree, please first read the [Filing an Issue](https://github.com/spree/spree/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#filing-an-issue)
guidelines. If you provide the information we ask for there, we will be able to
help you with your issue much more effectively.
